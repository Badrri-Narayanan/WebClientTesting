		// The test will pass if the application context loads without any exceptions.
		// You can add more specific tests for your application's functionality in separate test classes.
		// For example, you can test controllers, services, repositories, etc.
		// You can also use mocking frameworks like Mockito to create mock objects for testing.
		// This will help you isolate the components you want to test and verify their behavior.
